 * Parses arguments passed to the url at which the application is located. For example:
 *
 * http://www.mydomain.org/myapp.html?lat=-13.08191&lon=-38.73143&zoom=12&layers=0BF
 *
 * The ArgParser control will parse the lat, lon, zoom, and layers arguments on page load/refresh.
 * This can be used to initialize the map from the url.
 *
 * This control is added to OpenLayers maps by default.
 *
 * Other controls that are added by default are the {@link PanZoom},
 * Navigation, and {@link Attribution}.
