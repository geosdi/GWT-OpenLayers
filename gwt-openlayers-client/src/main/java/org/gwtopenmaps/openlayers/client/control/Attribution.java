/**
 * Must be activated on the map to show attributions that can be
 * set on layers. An example of an attribution is:
 *"This map is provided by <a href="url">company X</a>."
 *
 * Where the attribution must be specified depends on the layer.
 * For example, for WMS layers the attribution can be set as WMS layer
 * paramer, see {@link org.gwtopenmaps.openlayers.client.layer.WMSOptions}.
 *
 * This control is added to OpenLayers maps by default.
 *
 * Other controls that are added by default are the {@link PanZoom},
 * Navigation, and ArgParser.
