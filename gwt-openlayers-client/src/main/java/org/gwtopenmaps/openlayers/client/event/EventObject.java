/**
 * <p>Base class for event objects.</p>
 *
 * <b>Caveat: In Openlayers 2.x event handling is not yet implemented uniformly in OpenLayers. This should be fixed in version 3.x and higher.</b>
 * <p>
 * In OpenLayers, an event object is an argument that gets passed to the listener when it is called.
 * In GWT OpenLayers, this event object gets passed to the onHandle method of the EventHandler {@link EventHandler} when
 * the onHandle method is called. An event object class extending this base class can wrap this event object.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Depending on which event is fired, and from which source the event is fired
 * (e.g. Map, Layer, etc.), the event object may differ. Therefore, the
 * addXxxListener methods (see also {@link EventHandler}) that abstract from event registration details,
 * wrap the event object passed to onHandle in a way that is specific to the event.
 * </p>
